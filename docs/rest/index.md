What is a REST API? - [https://restfulapi.net/](https://restfulapi.net/)

## HTTP Request Lingo

When you are looking for answers, it helps to ask the right questions. If you want to get information from a REST API then you need to understand [HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

## HTTP Requests in JavaScript

I made my first API request with [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) from a broswer. Since then I have been learning more about [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to interact with REST APIs.

## My work life in JSON

I have to look at it so often now, when people start describing problems to me at work now I catch myself thinking about key value pairs and what things might be objects vs arrays. This is a great resource to uderstand what JSON is and why it is important.
