# QA-1191

Problem - How many primary and secondary answers are there in each environment for a list of codes ([bigQuery.csv](https://github.com/mshuber1981/work-life/blob/main/present/bigQuery.csv))? What metadata is associated with those answers?

Solution ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) + [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)):

1. [QA-1191-get](./QA-1191-GET.js) - Use a GET endpoint to roduce a list ([example](./QA-1191.json)) of formula components where saveIdsFromComponent is null && !(mobileType === "none" && autoCalculate === false)

2. [QA-1191-put](./QA-1191-PUT.js) - Read from a CSV file ([example](./QA-1191.csv)) containing the IDs and saveIdsFromComponent updates, then use a PUT endpoint to update each formula component.

## Example usage

### [AnswerCountReport.js](https://github.com/mshuber1981/work-life/blob/main/present/AnswerCountReports.js)

```javascript

```

### getAnswerCounts results

```json

```
