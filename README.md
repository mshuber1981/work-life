# Automating my work life

This repo is a collection of lengthy, repetitive, mind-numbing, and ultimately unsatisfying tasks from work I have automated out of my life forever! I enjoy learning about technology that can make my life easier, and sharing it with others to make their lives easier.

> I chose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.
